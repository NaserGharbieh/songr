# Songr Spring MVC app 
## This is a project for applaying what I learn in Spring MVC
## Curuntly this project has 3 routes:
- ### /hello 
- That of course returns an html page with the text : "hello world ".
- ### /capitalize/smalltext
- Which returns an html page with any text in UPPERCASE.
- ### /albums
- Which returns an html page with 3 Album objects with the album info and cover.
